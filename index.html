        <h2>What is Scout&trade;?</h2>
        <p>Scout is an open source application designed to help students at the University of Washington find and discover campus food establishments, study spaces, and technology that meet specific criteria. Currently, it is available as a mobile-optimized web application that can be accessed from any desktop computer or mobile device at <a href="http://scout.uw.edu/">Scout.uw.edu</a>. You can soon find Scout as a native app at the iTunes store and the Google Play store (Fall 2016). The app is a response to feedback from students about the difficulty of finding campus resources that meet their needs.</p>

        <p>Scout was developed by UW Information Technology in collaboration with UW Libraries, Housing and Food Services, Campus Technology and Events, and UW Computing Directors, and funded in part by the Student Technology Fee Committee. Scout was released to UW in September 2016, taking the place of the award-winning SpaceScout app, which focused on campus study spaces.</p>
